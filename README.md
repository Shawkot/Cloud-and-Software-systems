## This repo consists of all the code and implementations for the master's level course "Cloud and Software Systems." This course has 7 distinct modules, which introduce students to various emerging technologies in software development and cloud technology.

### Module 1: Introduction to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
#### Concepts learned:
  - Different services available on GCP
  - For example, VM instances, VPC networks, firewalls, etc.
  - Service accounts, IAM roles, setting up budgets, and related administrative tasks
  - Configuration of Google Cloud Shell on a local machine to interact with the platform via CLI
     
### Module 2: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
#### Related skills:
  - Infrastructure as Code using Terraform CDKTF
  - Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, e.g., cloud storage buckets, virtual machines, etc.
  - Using input and output variables, and environment variables in Terraform
  - Creating resources with block definitions, e.g., google_compute_instance, google_compute_network, google_compute_firewall, google_storage_bucket, and google_storage_bucket_object blocks
    
### Module 3: Software Container
#### Related skills:
  - Application containerization with Docker
  - Pulling Docker images from Docker Hub, publishing Docker images, and so on
  - Writing and building images with Dockerfile, including all necessary dependencies and build environments
  - Running Docker images as containers and managing containers and images from the Docker CLI
    
### Module 4: Container Orchestration and Serverless Computing
#### Skills learned:
  - Container orchestration with Kubernetes
  - Deploying Kubernetes clusters using Minikube
  - Networking and container runtime concepts in Kubernetes
  - Creating resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and other related objects using YAML manifest files
  - Managing Kubernetes clusters using client applications, e.g., kubectl
  - Serverless computing in GCP, especially Google Cloud Functions and Cloud Run
  - Writing HTTP functions and other event-driven functions in Python and Node, utilizing triggers like Pub/Sub, storage, and so on
      
### Module 5: API Design and Microservices
#### Skills learned:
  - Theoretical background of microservice design principles
  - API definition using the OpenAPI specification
  - Writing and validating APIs in Swagger Editor
  - Developing a Python-based application using FastAPI and MongoDB
  - Schema design in MongoDB, data validation, and type hints using Python's Pydantic library
  - Completing a full project where a sample application is built, then containerized with Docker, connected to a MongoDB database (running in another container), and finally deployed using Kubernetes
    
### Module 6: Cloud-based Communication
### Module 7: DevOps
